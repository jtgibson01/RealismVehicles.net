This is a direct copy of the non-executable source code from the final release of the Wintellect PowerCollections from Codeplex, i.e., in the state it was when Microsoft gutted their open-source database.  (Were I a suspicious sort, the loss of both Google Code and Codeplex would strike me as some sort of back room deal.)

The source code is compiled into the RealismVehicles.net runtime instead of referenced as an assembly.  RV.n makes use of the OrderedBag container class (for maintaining a collection of items in order), which is based on the RedBlack container class (a highly-efficient pre-sorted binary tree).  The rest of the source code is there for you to play with, too, if you want!  See License.txt for your redistribution rights.

Rest assured that this is 100% safe, as long as you obtained it directly from the RV.n package or from its official source, and it hasn't been modified in any way.  (As a lawyer-to-be, I'm on the opposite side of law and order than the side that would make malicious software. =P)

At time of writing, the unmodified archive can be obtained directly from:
https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=powercollections -- bearing in mind Chrome's unnecessary, illegitimate, dare I say antitrustworthy red-flagging of the site.
